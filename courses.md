{% capture discrete %}

Discrete math at UChicago (CMSC 27100) was the first proof-based class I took.
It definitely was very new at first, so I compiled my notes in an effort to
review.

There's also a <p><a href="{{ site.github.url }}/courses/discrete-math">page</a></p> for the course, but don't bother looking at it.
