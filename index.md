Hi! My name is Jack and I'm a second-year undergraduate at the University of Chicago studying computer science and statistics. I'm largely interested in AI security, including LLM attacks, defenses, and privacy preservation. This summer I'm working to create an [AI Security Course](https://xlabaisecurity.com/) along with some other undergraduates at UChicago. More generally, I'm interested in secure and robust ML as well as [AI safety](https://uchicagoaisafety.com/). I've also done work with UChicago's XLab on [compute-algorithm interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04075), which was featured on Epoch AI's [Gradient Updates](https://epoch.ai/gradient-updates/how-fast-can-algorithms-advance-capabilities). I'm best reached over [email](mailto:jacksanderson@uchicago.edu).
