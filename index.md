Hi! My name is Jack and I'm a second-year undergraduate at the University of
Chicago studying computer science and statistics. As far as research interests
go, I'm largely interested in AI security topics, including LLM attacks, defenses,
and privacy preservation. I've also done work with UChicago's XLab on
[compute-algorithm interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04075), which was 
featured on Epoch AI's [Gradient Updates](https://epoch.ai/gradient-updates/how-fast-can-algorithms-advance-capabilities).
I'm best reached over [email](mailto:jacksanderson@uchicago.edu).
