I am trying my best this summer to become more productive. I'm not a
serial doomscroller or anything, but I like small, incremental self-improvement.
I figure I'm going to start keeping a timeline of my systems and routines to
see how things change over time (some of this will be backfilled; I'm starting
this in July of 2025).

## Timeline

- July 2025: started using FlashSpace
    - I initially setup Aerospace but found it a bit clunky for my liking.
    - I'm more of a one screen, one task guy, so I didn't care at all about
    tiling and just wanted the space control. FlashSpace does this faster and
    more efficiently.

- July 2025: blocked (most) social media on my laptop.
    - It was becoming way too easy to open a twitter or reddit tab when I was
    bored, so I blocked both of their home feeds.
    - I can still search for a youtube video or specific subreddits.

- June 2025: mapped `Ctrl + H/L` to Mac spaces navigation.
    - I was sick of having to swipe on the trackpad or use Alfred to switch
    apps.
    - Unfortunately it was still a bit slow.

- September 2024: downloaded ScreenZen.
    - This is probably the single best decision I've ever made. Thank you Drew Gooden.
    - Limit: 5 opens/app, 7 minutes each (for all social media).

- May 2024: started using neovim.
    - After using vanilla vim for a few months, neovim was a nice upgrade.
    - I still use the same base (kickstart) config to this day. I try my best to
      keep my config files clean and keep my config minimal.

- March 2024: started using vim.
    - It was recommended by my professor for Introduction to C programming. Glad
      I stuck with it.

- March 2024: stopped meditating daily.
    - Don't have a great explanation for why other than it became less of a
    priority.
    - (Vim became my meditation.)

- January 2024: started meditating daily.
