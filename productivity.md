I am trying my best this summer to become more productive. I'm not a
serial doomscroller or anything, but I like small, incremental self-improvement.
I figure I'm going to start keeping a timeline of my systems and routines to
see how things change over time (some of this will be backfilled; I'm starting
this in July of 2025).

#### timeline

{% capture flashspace %}

I am now using [FlashSpace](https://github.com/wojciech-kulik/FlashSpace) to manage spaces. I initially set up Aerospace but found it a bit clunky for my liking. I'm more of a one screen, one task guy, so I didn't care at all about tiling and just wanted the space control. FlashSpace does this faster and more efficiently.

{% capture mediablock %}

It was becoming way to easy for me to just open twitter or reddit and doomscroll, so I've setup ublock to block the home screen for both of these apps (also youtube). I can still search for a youtube video or specific subreddits.

{% capture spacesnav %}

This was because I was sick of using the trackpad to move between spaces.

It was still a bit too slow for me, which is why I've since switched to FlashSpace.

{% capture screenzen %}

This is probably the single best decision I've ever made. Thank you Drew Gooden. My limit is 5 opens/app, 7 minutes each (for all social media). 

After a year, I usually don't even reach 1 open for each app.

{% capture neovim %}

After using vanilla vim for a few months, neovim was a nice upgrade. I still use the same base (kickstart) config to this day. I try my best to keep my config files clean and keep my config minimal.

{% capture vim %}

It was recommended by my professor for Introduction to C programming. Glad I stuck with it.

{% capture vim %}

I started meditating daily in January of 2024, but stopped by March. Don't have a great explanation for why other than it became less of a priority. (Vim became my meditation.)
