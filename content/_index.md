Hi! My name is Jack and I'm a third-year undergraduate at the University of Chicago studying computer science and statistics. I'm largely interested in AI security, including model tampering, backdooring, and data poisoning. This summer I created an [AI Security Course](https://xlabaisecurity.com/) along with some other undergrads at UChicago. I'm also involved in the field of [AI safety](https://uchicagoaisafety.com/) (although I reject many of the field's most common views). In the past, I did investigated [compute-algorithm interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04075), which was featured on Epoch AI's [Gradient Updates](https://epoch.ai/gradient-updates/how-fast-can-algorithms-advance-capabilities). I'm best reached over [email](mailto:jacksanderson@uchicago.edu).
