Hi! My name is Jack and I'm a third-year undergrad at the University of Chicago studying statistics and computer science. I'm largely interested in AI security, including model tampering, data poisoning, and automated adaptive attacks. This summer I created an [AI Security Course](https://xlabaisecurity.com/) along with some [other undergrads](https://zephaniahdev.com/) at UChicago. I'm also generally involved with [AI safety](https://uchicagoaisafety.com/) (although I reject many of the field's common views). In the past, I investigated [compute-algorithm interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04075), which was featured on Epoch AI's [Gradient Updates](https://epoch.ai/gradient-updates/how-fast-can-algorithms-advance-capabilities).
