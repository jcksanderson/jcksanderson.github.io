This site is ever evolving (about once per month). Here are some facts about me:
- I'm a big fan of the Chicago Bears and Cubs
- I play the ukulele
- I'm an *avid* neovim user

If you have a fun fact you'd like me to put here, shoot me an email!

Here's a beautiful poem of mine about global warming:
```
see low
c o
o 2
oh no

see high
sea rise
oh me
oh my

we hide
disguise
but fate
wonâ€™t lie
```
