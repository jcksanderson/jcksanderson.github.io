This site is ever evolving (say once per month). I want it to be minimal, fast, and user-friendly. The design is largely inspired by the personal website of [Alexander Paulin](https://math.berkeley.edu/~apaulin/index.html) and partially by [Henry Josephson](https://www.henryjosephson.com/) and [Daniel Paleka](https://danielpaleka.com/).

Here are some facts about me:
- I'm a big fan of the Chicago Bears and Cubs
- I play the ukulele
- I'm an avid neovim user
- [I love crows!]({{< ref "fun/crows.md" >}})

If you have a fun fact you'd like me to put here, shoot me an email!
