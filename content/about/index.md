This site is ever evolving (about once per month). I want it to be minimal, fast, and user-friendly. The design is largely inspired by the personal website of [Alexander Paulin](https://math.berkeley.edu/~apaulin/index.html) and partially by [Henry Josephson](https://www.henryjosephson.com/) and [Daniel Paleka](https://danielpaleka.com/).

Here are some facts about me:
- I'm a big fan of the Chicago Bears and Cubs
- I play the ukulele
- I'm an *avid* neovim user
- I'm am anti-rationalist effective altruism sympathizer (not apologist) ([source](https://substack.com/@titotal))

If you have a fun fact you'd like me to put here, shoot me an email!

Here's a beautiful poem of mine about global warming:
```
see low
c o
o 2
oh no

see high
sea rise
oh me
oh my

we hide
disguise
but fate
won’t lie
```
